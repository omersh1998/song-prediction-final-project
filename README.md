# song-prediction-final-project
A python machine learning project predicting wether or not a song will become a 'Hit' song

In this project we have a .ipynb file which is the main file of the project.
In there we scrape data from multiple sources, we use api to acquire extra data and information to enrich our dataset.

We also have a data directory where we store the data we retrieve because it's a long process to get it and we don't want to waste time.

### Project steps:
    1) We use Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape wikipedia and get the list of songs and artists

    2) We use the spotify api to enrich our songs dataset with more information

    3) We will clean the data, remove duplicates, etc.
    
    4) We visualize and explore the data to get a better understanding.

    5) We will create prediction models and rate them to try and predict what song will be a 'Hit'
